 * those actually answer the question. They were two sidebar entries, which
 * made a single pipeline read as two unrelated settings and put the embedding
 * width and the reranker candidate count a navigation apart.
 *
 * The layout is: both Active cards first (the two decisions), then a switcher
 * over the two provider stacks (the configuration behind them). The Active
 * cards stay above the switcher on purpose — they are what the page is FOR,
 * and burying either inside a tab would mean you cannot see which embedding
 * model you are on while looking at reranker providers.

                tablist. The constraints below are load-bearing and were each
                paid for there:

                - No `layoutId` shared-layout element. This is ONE pill node that
                  never unmounts, springing `x` across the track. The layoutId
                  version forced a measure pass around the panel unmount/mount,
                  the scroller's content transiently collapsed below scrollTop +
                  clientHeight, and Chromium clamped — switching tabs from a
                  scrolled position snapped the panel back to the top (measured
                  there: scrollTop 260 -> 0 with layoutId, 260 -> 260 without).
                - The track has NO `overflow-hidden`. The spring overshoots the
                  hop while the track has only 4px of `p-1` to spare, so on the
                  end tabs the clip shaved the pill's outer edge flat for a few
                  frames — exactly the part of the feel being ported.
                - Transform-only. The tabs never restyle their background, which
                  is what stops the colour swap a per-button `bg` transition
                  produces; only the label colour crossfades, from `.aip-tab`. */}
